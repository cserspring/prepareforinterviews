Max heap is the heap whose root is largest
Min heap is the heap whose root is smallest

Find running median from a stream of integers?

There are a number of different solutions for finding running median from streamed data, 
I will briefly talk about them at the very end of the answer.

The question is about the details of the a specific solution (max heap/min heap solution), 
and how heap based solution works is explained below:

For the first two elements add smaller one to the maxHeap on the left, and bigger one to the 
minHeap on the right. Then process stream data one by one,

Step 1: Add next item to one of the heaps

   if next item is smaller than maxHeap root add it to maxHeap,
   else add it to minHeap

Step 2: Balance the heaps (after this step heaps will be either balanced or
   one of them will contain 1 more item)

   if number of elements in one of the heaps is greater than the other by
   more than 1, remove the root element from the one containing more elements and
   add to the other one
Then at any given time you can calculate median like this:

   If the heaps contain equal elements;
     median = (root of maxHeap + root of minHeap)/2
   Else
     median = root of the heap with more elements
Now I will talk about the problem in general as promised in the beginning of the question. 
Finding running median from a stream of data is a tough problem, and finding an exact solution 
with memory constraints efficiently is probably impossible for the general case. On the other 
hand, if the data has some characteristics we can exploit, we can develop efficient specialized 
solutions. For example, if we know that the data is an integral type, then we can use counting 
sort, which can give you a constant memory constant time algorithm. Heap based solution is a 
more general solution because it can be used for other data types (doubles) as well. And finally, 
if the exact median is not required and an approximation is enough, you can just try to estimate 
a probability density function for the data and estimate median using that.
